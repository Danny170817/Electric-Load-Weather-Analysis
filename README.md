# Exploratory Data Analysis: Electric Load & Weather

This project performs an exploratory analysis on hourly electric load and temperature data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.

## 📌 Objectives

- Explore time-based consumption patterns
- Analyze correlations between temperature and electricity usage
- Visualize seasonal or hourly trends
- (Optional) Build a basic regression model

## 🗂️ Structure

- `data/raw/` — Raw dataset (hourly electric load and temperature)
- `src/` — Python modules for preprocessing, EDA, and modeling
- `notebooks/` — Main Jupyter notebook
- `reports/` — Summary of findings
- `figures/` — Exported visualizations

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
